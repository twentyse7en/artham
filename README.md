 ## Why?
 [Olam](https://olam.in/) is great, but you need to explicitly search. Other Malayalam dictionary extension had limited meaning and font was small. Also I would like to check on English meaning too. And I love ipad look up ui üåà
 
 ## Installation
 I haven't uploaded to chrome store yet, This will be done after proper testing.
 For current using:
 - clone the repo
 - go to `chrome://extensions`
 - click on load unpacked
 - select the chrome folder of cloned repo
 
 ## Usage
 - Double click on the word or Add a secondary key through option (may be add instruction steps), then key + double click.
 - Single click to remove the popup
 
 note: seconday key combo will be useful if you use site which you double click and doesn't need a meaning.
 When I use [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), I had double clicks that doesn't need a meaning. Other option was to add a blocklist, which
 I'm lazy to add.
 
 ## TODO
 - [ ] Properly test and release on chrome store
 - [ ] Add support for Firefox
 - [ ] Better development setup
    - [ ] Web component build create unnecessary files
    - [ ] Can't live test web component with extension
